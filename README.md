# snake
Python snake game for MOOC programming final exercise

I wanted to test out github usage, even though I have finished this coding project already.
We were given the following restrictions for this project:

>Create a game with the followin grestrictions without using any external pictures not provided with the source code. Your game should follow the requirements:
>- A character that can move
>- Something that can be collected and/or enemies
>- Clear goal
>- A counter, which indicates, how gaming goes
>- Well constructed functions as in an example provided

My first intention was to create Pacman, but with the given deadlines and the issues with turning surface objects into images, i scrapped the project a day before the deadline and started over.
